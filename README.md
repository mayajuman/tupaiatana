Data and code for my senior thesis research on Large Treeshrew (*Tupaia tana*) taxonomy (Juman et al. 2021)

# Overview
My <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jmammal/gyab059/6301373#265010819" target="_blank">senior thesis</a> focused on infraspecific taxonomy and ecogeographic patterns in Large Treeshrews (*Tupaia tana*) from Southeast Asia. I analyzed multivariate morphometric data from the skulls and hands of museum specimens to examine subspecies boundaries. We concluded that there is osteological support for only two, rather than 15, subspecies: *T. t. tana* on Sumatra and *T. t. speciosa* on Borneo. We also observed a reversal of Foster's (1964) island rule, which predicts insular gigantism in small mammals. *T. t. speciosa* instead averages a smaller body size on offshore islands relative to mainland populations.

# Files
FinalAnalyses.Rmd contains all final PCA and DFA code as well as preliminary t-tests and mixed-effect models. Skull and manus data subsets are located in /data. Code for generating final figures, as well as locality data, can be found in /figures.

Final publication output, including the complete supplementary data file, is stored in /publication.
